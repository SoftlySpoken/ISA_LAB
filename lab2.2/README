# Support:
# RISC-V greencard ISA except ecall & mulh
# Run by step

# Simulators command usage
# q: quit
# r: run the program
# d: change step mode
# m $start $num: check the memory of last running program, $start = the beginning of what you want to see, $num = the number of bytes to show
# l $file_name : read elf file into simulator

# Running debug command usage:
# r: show register
# m $start $num: show memory, $start = the beginning of what you want to see, $num = the number of bytes to show
# c: run one step
